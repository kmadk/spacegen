# FIR: Space IS The Computer 🌌

**The end of applications. The beginning of spatial computing.**

> _"We're not building on the web. We're building what comes after the web."_

## 🚀 The Revolution

Traditional development is dead. URLs are obsolete. Pages are history.

**Welcome to spatial computing** - where position IS the program, zoom IS the query, and movement IS the execution.

## 🎯 What Is FIR?

FIR transforms Figma designs into infinite spatial applications where:

- **Position determines everything** - Where you are IS what you see
- **Zoom creates meaning** - Scale determines data granularity
- **Navigation is computation** - Movement through space executes logic
- **Design is the application** - No code, just space

## 🔧 The IR Advantage: Why FIR is a Platform

FIR uses an Intermediate Representation (IR) - this is what makes FIR a **platform**, not just a tool:

### Multi-Source Design Input

- **Figma** designs → IR
- **Sketch** files → IR (coming)
- **AI prompts** → IR (coming)
- **Direct authoring** → IR

### Multi-Target Reality Output

- IR → **Web** (DOM spatial canvas)
- IR → **Native** (iOS/Android apps)
- IR → **Voice** (accessible narration)
- IR → **AR/VR** (true 3D space)

### Semantic Intelligence Layer

The IR isn't just layout - it carries runtime intelligence:

- **Zoom semantics** - Different data at different scales
- **Spatial queries** - Position generates SQL automatically
- **Performance optimization** - 50x smaller than source files
- **Security boundaries** - Position-based permissions

Without IR, we'd be just another Figma viewer. With IR, we're the **spatial computing platform**.

## 🏃‍♀️ Quick Start

```bash
# Install the spatial kernel
pnpm install
pnpm build

# Experience infinite zoom (basic preview)
pnpm serve examples/agency-dashboard/app.ir.json
# Open http://localhost:8080
# Scroll to zoom through semantic levels
# Click and drag to navigate infinite space

# Coming next week: Full spatial kernel
pnpm spatial:serve examples/agency-dashboard/app.ir.json
# Position generates queries
# Zoom determines scope
# Movement triggers computation
```

## 🌍 The Spatial Experience

### Quantum Level (0.001x zoom)

See individual data points, raw bytes, system internals

### Atomic Level (0.01x zoom)

Browse individual fields, single records, detailed values

### Molecular Level (0.1x zoom)

View relationships, connections, data structures

### Standard Level (1x zoom)

Normal interface - forms, tables, components

### System Level (10x zoom)

Department overview, aggregations, KPIs

### Universal Level (100x+ zoom)

Entire organization, complete system view

## 🎭 The New Reality

### Position = API

```typescript
// Every coordinate has an implicit endpoint
{ x: 1000, y: 500 } → GET /space/1000/500
{ x: 1000, y: 500 } → POST /space/1000/500
```

### Zoom = Query Scope

```typescript
// Zoom level determines data granularity
0.01x → SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123
1x → SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 100
10x → SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(revenue) FROM users
```

### Movement = State Change

```typescript
// Navigation IS the application logic
navigate(from: {0,0,1}, to: {1000,500,10})
// Triggers data load, permission check, state transition
```

## 🎯 Building in Phases: Enterprise First

### Phase 1: Enterprise Scale (Now - 2 Weeks)

Perfect for internal tools and dashboards:

- **Scale**: 1,000s of entities
- **Performance**: 60fps guaranteed
- **Use Cases**: Admin panels, dashboards, data explorers
- **Value**: Replace expensive development teams

### Phase 2: Application Scale (Month 2)

Consumer and SaaS applications:

- **Scale**: 100,000s of entities
- **Performance**: Tile streaming, progressive loading
- **Use Cases**: E-commerce, content sites, SaaS tools
- **Value**: Ship instantly, update live

### Phase 3: Universe Scale (Month 6)

Infinite applications:

- **Scale**: Millions of entities
- **Performance**: WebGL/GPU, distributed rendering
- **Use Cases**: Social networks, maps, metaverse
- **Value**: New types of applications never before possible

## 🔮 Current Status

| Component            | Status      | Description                        |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Spatial Kernel       | 🚧 Building | Infinite canvas engine             |
| Cinematic Navigation | 🚧 Building | Physics-based movement             |
| Semantic Zoom        | ✅ Basic    | Different data at different scales |
| Portal Network       | 📅 Next     | Click to zoom navigation           |
| Figma Bridge         | 📅 Soon     | Direct design execution            |

## 💡 Why This Changes Everything

**Before:** Design → Code → Deploy → Maintain → Debug → Suffer

**After:** Design = Application (No steps. No translation. No code.)

## 🛠️ Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the revolution
git clone https://github.com/fir/spatial
cd figma-runtime-monorepo-v0_6

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Start spatial preview
pnpm serve examples/agency-dashboard/app.ir.json

# Run tests (what tests? the design IS the test)
pnpm test
```

## 🌈 Examples

### Dashboard at Different Zooms

```bash
# Standard view (1x) - see normal dashboard
pnpm serve examples/agency-dashboard/app.ir.json

# Zoom out (0.1x) - tables become counts
# Zoom in (10x) - see individual transactions
# Pan left (x: -1000) - see historical data
# Pan right (x: 1000) - see projections
```

## 🚀 The Roadmap
