## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Design Your Dashboard in Figma

```
Frame: Dashboard (main container)
├── Frame: Metrics (top region)
│   ├── Text: Revenue: $1.2M
│   ├── Text: Users: 45,231
│   └── Text: Growth: +23%
├── Frame: UserTable (center)
│   └── [Your table design]
└── Frame: Charts (bottom)
    └── [Your chart designs]
```

### 2. Add FIR Plugin (Coming Week 2)

```bash
# For now, export and use CLI
pnpm install -g @fir/cli
ir import dashboard.fig dashboard.ir.json
```

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
# Start spatial runtime
ir serve dashboard.ir.json

# Open browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

### 4. Deploy to Your Domain

```bash
# One command deployment (Coming Week 3)
ir deploy dashboard.ir.json --domain dashboard.company.com
```

## 📊 Enterprise Architecture

### Scale Progression

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1-1000 nodes)

```
Your Figma → IR → Local Preview
```

- Test with internal team
- Validate approach
- No infrastructure needed

#### Phase 2: Department Rollout (1000-10,000 nodes)

```
Figma → IR → Edge Deploy → Your Domain
```

- Deploy to subdomain
- Add authentication
- Connect to your data

#### Phase 3: Company Wide (10,000-100,000 nodes)

```
Figma → IR → CDN → Global Edge → Enterprise SSO
```

- Global performance
- Full security integration
- Real-time sync

#### Phase 4: Platform Scale (100,000+ nodes)

```
Multiple Figmas → IR Platform → Multi-Region → Custom Infrastructure
```

- Your own spatial platform
- White-label solution
- Unlimited scale

## 🔒 Enterprise Security

### Built-in Security Features

- **Position-based permissions** - Location determines access
- **Zoom-level authorization** - Deeper zoom needs higher clearance
- **Spatial boundaries** - Regions with access control
- **Audit trails** - Every movement logged

### Integration Points

```typescript
// Your existing auth
ir.configure({
  auth: {
    provider: "okta", // or Auth0, Azure AD, etc.
    endpoint: "https://company.okta.com",
    roles: ["admin", "user", "viewer"],
  },
});

// Your existing data
ir.configure({
  data: {
    type: "postgres", // or MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    readonly: false,
  },
});
```

## 💬 Common Questions

### "Is this production-ready?"

For internal tools with <10k entities, yes. For customer-facing applications, Q2 2024.

### "Can it replace our existing stack?"

Gradually. Start with new tools, migrate legacy over time.

### "What about complex business logic?"

Logic becomes spatial. Workflows become journeys. It's different, but more intuitive.

### "How do we train our team?"

Designers already know Figma. Users already understand space. Training is minimal.

### "What if you disappear?"

Open source core. Your IR files are portable. No vendor lock-in.
